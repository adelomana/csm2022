Systems biology is an interdisciplinary field that studies the biological phenomena that emerge from multiple interacting biological elements.
Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of biological systems is a particular focus of systems biology.
In this course, we will prioritise aspects of systems biology relevant to human health and disease.

# About
The course dedicates each day to a systems biology highlight relevant to human health

| Week day      | Clinical challenge | Computational approach |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Monday  | Disease subtyping  | Clustering |
| Tuesday  | Biomarker discovery | Classification |
| Wednesday  | Disease mechanism discovery  |Gene regulatory network inference |
| Thursday  | Microbial interactions  | Microbiome analysis |

On Friday we will have a symposium and round table on the topic of __Solutions against infectious disease__.

# Structure
The course activities mimic the research experience---learning about cutting-edge research, understanding the principles behind current research, reading and interpreting scientific papers, using computational tools in Python and R, working on a research project and presentation of scientific results.

Monday to Thursday, we will first start with a fascinating lecture about the state-of-the-art research in the field by an established researcher.
We will continue with a didactical lecture by an instructor about the fundamental quantitative concepts necessary to generate the research results just presented.
We will end the morning with our instructors providing a walk-through introduction to computational tools that build upon the learned concepts towards the generation of results of clinical relevance.
After lunch, we will resume the course with the introduction to a battery of datasets and research questions amenable to analysis on the topic of the day.
Students will form groups of three to five people to work together cooperatively during two and a half hours to discover and interpret results from the presented questions.
Finally, student groups will present to the audience their new findings and interpretations at the end of the day.

The course will be taught in English.

# Audience
The intended audience for this course is graduate students, postdocs, principal investigators, industry scientists, educators, clinicians, or any other variety of person from across the globe interested in systems biology approaches applied to quantify health and disease.

No prior knowledge of molecular biology or programming is required.
However, a basic understanding of both molecular biology and Python/R is desirable.
Students without prior knowledge of cell and molecular biology are warmly encouraged to review the basic concepts in those fields; similarly, students without programming experience are also encouraged to follow any of the many free basic introductory hands-on courses to Python available online.

# Course requirements
During the course we will use Zoom and Slack as primary tools for communication. Please make sure you have them installed in your computer.

Course materials will be distributed via the course GitHub repository.
We will be using both Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio as coding environments.
Please make sure you are familiar with them and you can use them from your laptop.

No prior knowledge of molecular biology or programming is required.
However, a basic understanding of both molecular biology and Python/R is desirable.
Students without prior knowledge of cell and molecular biology are warmly encouraged to review the basic concepts in those fields.
Examples of external publicly available materials introductory to molecular biology can be found here: a short introduction and an extensive introduction. Similarly, students without programming experience are warmly advised to follow any of the many free basic introductory hands-on courses to Python available online.  

You will need to bring your own laptop.
