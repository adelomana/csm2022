Systems biology is an interdisciplinary field that studies the biological phenomena that emerge from multiple interacting biological elements.
Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of biological systems is a particular focus of systems biology.
In this course, we will prioritise aspects of systems biology relevant to human health and disease.  

# About
The course dedicates each day to a systems biology highlight relevant to human health:

| Week day      | Clinical challenge | Computational approach |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Monday  | Disease subtyping  | Clustering |
| Tuesday  | Biomarker discovery | Classification |
| Wednesday  | Disease mechanism discovery  |Gene regulatory network inference |
| Thursday  | Microbial interactions  | Microbiome analysis |

On Friday we will have a symposium and round table on the topic of *Solutions against infectious disease*.

# Structure
The course activities mimic a research experience, including learning about cutting-edge research, understanding the principles behind current research, reading and interpreting scientific papers, using computational tools in Python and R, working on a research project and presentation of scientific results.

The course will be taught in English.

# Course requirements
During the course we will use Zoom and Slack as primary tools for communication. Please make sure you have them installed in your computer.

Course materials will be distributed via the course GitHub repository.
We will be using both Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio as coding environments.
Please make sure you are familiar with them and you can use them from your laptop.

No prior knowledge of molecular biology or programming is required.
However, a basic understanding of both molecular biology and Python/R is desirable.
Students without prior knowledge of cell and molecular biology are warmly encouraged to review the basic concepts in those fields.
Examples of external publicly available materials introductory to molecular biology can be found here: a short introduction and an extensive introduction. Similarly, students without programming experience are warmly advised to follow any of the many free basic introductory hands-on courses to Python available online.  

You will need to bring your own laptop.
