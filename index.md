Systems biology is an interdisciplinary field that studies the biological phenomena that emerge from multiple interacting biological elements.
Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of biological systems is a particular focus of systems biology.
In this course, we will prioritise aspects of systems biology relevant to human health and disease.  

# About
The course dedicates each day to a systems biology topic relevant to human health:

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

During the first four days students  divided in four days  an introduction to a selected topics of systems biology.


1) basic principles in modelling molecular networks, both gene regulatory and metabolic networks; 2) cellular phenomena that support homeostasis like tissue morphogenesis and microbiome resilience, and 3) learning of molecular patterns relevant to human diseases in genomics data at a population scale, such as patient classification and biomarker discovery. In this manner, the course covers the three major scales in systems biology: molecules, cells and organisms.
The course activities mimic a research experience, including reading and interpreting scientific papers, using computational tools in Python and R, working on a research project and presentation of scientific results.
Lectures will comprise both (1) presentations on foundational concepts and (2) hands-on coding practical sessions. The course will be taught in English.

# Course requirements
During the course we will use Zoom and Slack as primary tools for communication. Please make sure you have them installed in your computer.

Course materials will be distributed via the course GitHub repository.
We will be using both Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio as coding environments.
Please make sure you are familiar with them and you can use them from your laptop.

No prior knowledge of molecular biology or programming is required.
However, a basic understanding of both molecular biology and Python/R is desirable.
Students without prior knowledge of cell and molecular biology are warmly encouraged to review the basic concepts in those fields.
Examples of external publicly available materials introductory to molecular biology can be found here: a short introduction and an extensive introduction. Similarly, students without programming experience are warmly advised to follow any of the many free basic introductory hands-on courses to Python available online.  

You will need to bring your own laptop.
